          <aside class="notes">
            Thanks for joining us this evening. My name is Mathieu Gauthron, I'm an independent IT consultant working in financial services industry. I specialise in Distributed computing/big data. I also happen to also be a customer of various P2P lending companies like Funding Circle who are kindly hosting us tonight (Thank you Funding Circle...). ;) 
            
In the next 20 mins we are going see that Peer2Peer lending transactions can be used to generate a report using Spark Dataframes. To understand the user case, we are going to place ourselves in the skin of a Peer2Peer lender like a company Director who faces the challenge of trying to understand were their money is and how much it returns because frankly we will see the current platform reporting interfaces out there are quite basic and lack some of the basic information that would be required by a company's accountant to track the account.

		<h3>Why Peer2Peer lending?</h3>
		<img height="30%" width="30%" src="img/Years-vs-investment-products-01-1.png" alt="peer-to-peer-lending">
			<ol>
				<li class="fragment">Stock & Share is very volatile</li>
                                <li class="fragment">Saving Account returns less than inflation</li>
				<li class="fragment">P2P rates are relatively high</li>
				<li class="fragment">P2P money is accessible*</li>
			</ol>
<small>*P2P capital is at risk</small>
		<aside class="notes">
			Who knows anything about p2p lending?
			Just a quick word on why customers would want to use it. 
			Entities that are cash flow rich have limited options to protect their reserves against inflation in a low interest rate environment like today. Investing in stocks & shares is very volatile (*enter*) which means the capital reserves might have shrunk when the cash is needed. Keeping the money in a saving account (*enter*) with current market rates means losing money slowly over time because of inflation. Peer2Peer lending offers above inflation growth rates (*enter*) whilst protecting the customer from day-to-day capital mark-to-market volatility (however the Capital is at Risk!).
In other words, Peer2Peer lending platforms like Funding Circle are increasing in popularity and offer an attractive way to boost the risk/return premium profile of a company reserves whilst keeping its capital available at short notice(*enter*). (*pause*)

		<h3>Peer2peer Platform reporting shortfalls</h3>
		<img  src="img/Funding-circle-average-anualised-1.png" alt="Funding-circle-average-anualised">

		<aside class="notes">
This is the typical reporting interface available on a p2p platform. balance figures, interest... Great but this just a snapshot.
Not like bank a/c, no balance for yesterday, last month, last year.  etc...

		<h3>Peer2peer Platform reporting shortfalls</h3>
		<img height="80%" width="80%" src="img/fc-tax-statement.png" alt="fc-tax-statement">

		<aside class="notes">
p2p platforms also provide tax statement which HMRC will need deduct tax on the income generated.
But this is limited. No balance etc...

Typically account track accounts across the financial year. They'll want to value the account at the beg, end and possibly quarterly.

note:
CSV file can be extracted. They typically come with no documentation. The transactions of this large table contains a description and and an amount which we need to categories to generate a report. Because of the large number of lines (circa 20k/year) we need a better tool than excel. Spark Dataframes will enable use to drill through this data and work out a way to categories the content before we can run a series of reports.

## Simple Dataframe creation
```clojure

	  '( ( "interest payment 1"  2)

	     ( "interest payment 2"  4)
	     ( "fee"                 1)
	     ( "interest payment 3"  3))))
```
```clojure
  (.show df 50 false)
